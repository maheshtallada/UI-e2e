<!-- 

As soon as we hear radio button, we wonder how one gets deselected when we select the other radio button.

That happens with help of name attribute. value of the 'name' should be same for one group of radios.


value attribute is used in server side, ignore for now-->
Male <input type="radio" name="MaleFemale" value="male"> 
Female <input type="radio" name="MaleFemale" value="female"> 

<!-- try to give a different values for each name attribute and watch that we can select both the buttons-->
