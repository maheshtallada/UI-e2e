In HTML, we saw the hierarchy of tags that html contains head and body. 

head contains meta, style and title

body contains all sort of elements which renders content into browser.




CSS Inheritance :: 

In previous examples, we saw that if we keep a selector say p{ <styles> }, it applies for all p tags.

and, we know that all these p elements are in body element

The CSS Inheritance works in such a way that, if we style body element, that applies to all the child elements in it.


Ex: Let's say we want to apply color to entire text in body whiever sub element the content may be in,  we can use below.


OVERRIDING:

Now, if you want entire body to have some value for a particular property, lets say green for color: prop. But you want p tags to have red color,

you can add color property for p tags, that works and called overriding.
