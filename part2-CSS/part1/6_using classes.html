<!--     IF we want one p element to have one style and other p element to have another style, how would we do that ??

that's where classes comes in

define a name for attribute 'class'  for each p and then add style to that class

Ex: <p class="description paragraph"> text </p>
<p class="overview paragraph"> text </p>

now we can use class names as selectors to apply styles

p.class means-- this block of styling will be applicable to that class which are attributed for  tags. if we want to apply style for all tags of that class, jsut remove p and use     .description {
														<styles>
													}
-->


<style>

body {

color: green;

}

h1, h2 {

border-bottom: 1px solid black;

}



p.description {
	color: red;
	font-size: 25px;
	font-family: Helvetica;
}

p.overview {
	color: blue;
	font-size: 15px;
	font-family: Helvetica;
}

</style>
