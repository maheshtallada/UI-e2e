<!--
As we learnt in last session, we can either keep p.class  means more specifying that, this style block applies for elemts with p and with that class
OR we can simply use .class

we will see how to use .class which applies style for all elements with that class

******************************************************
for a particular element we can define multiple classses by specifying 2nd class name with just a space

Ex:  <p class="description information"> TEXT </p>

now whatever the style we define in these two classes will apply for above p


NEW PROPERTY : 

text-decoration: underline;
